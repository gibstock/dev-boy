<h1>about</h1>
<p>I'm in the midst of a grand career change, but in my past life I was a bartender.</p>
<p>As a bartender for the past decade, <span class='punch'>problem solving in real-time</span> was a constant necessity to succeed. There was never a day where everything went “smoothly” on its own, which meant there were endless opportunities for <span class='punch'>creative solutions</span>.</p> 

<p>With bartending success came more responsibilities like <span class='punch'>managing teams</span> and <span class='punch'>interfacing with suppliers</span>. This is where my <span class='punch'>effective and clear communication</span> shone through. There are clear parallels between the bartending and computing industries:</p> 

<h2>Computing VS Bartending</h2>

            <td class="comparison">learning new languages and functions&colon; memorizing countless cocktail recipes</td>

            <td class="line">2</td>
            <td class="comparison">using the languages and conventions established by management: following the bar procedures and protocols of wherever I worked</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="line">3</td>
            <td class="comparison">listening and adhering to clients’ needs: adapting to the need of every patron (client) that sat at my bar</td>
        </tr>

<h2>Takeway</h2>
<p>The wisdom leading to my success as a bartender was to <em>always enter a new situation with an <span class='punch'>open and elastic mind</span></em>. <br class="mobile-break"> <br class="mobile-break"> Quite too often, bartenders carry with them a ‘know-it-all’ attitude and that may give them success, but it is usually short lived. <br class="mobile-break"><br class="mobile-break">However, by allowing myself to <span class='punch'>listen and learn</span> the system of the current bar completely, I was always able to understand why they did things a certain way, then I could <span class='punch'>help make operations smoother</span>, which led to a sturdier program and longterm successs for the business.</p>
